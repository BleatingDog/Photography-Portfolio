        <h2>Capturing Timeless Moments on Your Special Day</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>Photo Impact</strong>, we understand that your wedding day is 
          one of the most important milestones in your life. 
          With over 20 years of experience, our lead photographer 
          Mauricio Gonzalez specializes in capturing the emotions, 
          joy, and beauty of every moment — from the first look to 
          the final dance.
          Based in New York, we offer complete wedding coverage 
          tailored to your unique story. Whether it's a grand 
          celebration at a historic venue, an intimate ceremony in a
          charming park, or a vibrant city rooftop event, we bring 
          professionalism, creativity, and passion to every frame.
