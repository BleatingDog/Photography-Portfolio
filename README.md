# ðŸ“¸ Photo Impact

Welcome to **Photo Impact**, a photography services website offering coverage for:
- QuinceaÃ±eras
- Weddings
- Private Events
- Personal & Family Photoshoots

This project includes a multi-page responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with modularized headers and footers using JavaScript and local storage for basic login/logout functionality.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

You have multiple ways to run this website locally:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Use Live Server (Recommended)

If you use **Visual Studio Code**:

1. Install the Live Server extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open your project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. The website will automatically open in your browser and reload with changes.

> âœ… This is the easiest and most reliable way to test JavaScript `fetch()` calls for headers and footers.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Run with Python (If You Donâ€™t Have Live Server)

If you have Python installed:

- **Python 3:**
  ```bash
  python -m http.server

- **Python 2:**
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This will start a local server. Open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:8000
