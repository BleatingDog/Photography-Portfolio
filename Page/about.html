        Photo Impact was founded over a decade ago with a single goal: to capture timeless, high-quality images 
        that speak louder than words. With over 10 years in the industry and led by our passionate head photographer 
        Mauricio Gonzalez—who brings more than 20 years of experience covering weddings, quinceañeras, private events, 
        and parties—we've built a reputation for excellence, dedication, and personalized service.
